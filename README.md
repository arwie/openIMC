Real-time robotics kernel compiled as python module implemented in rust.
What do you think?

What if real-time robotics was just an import in python and the machine control could be implemented with asyncio?

This is my experiment with:
- ruckig online trajectory generator
- python module compiled in rust
- web-based robot visualization using three.js
- websocket server in python asyncio
